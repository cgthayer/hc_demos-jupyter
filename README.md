# Demos using Jupyterlab

This repo was forked from larryebaum/hc_demos-jupyter. The contents below is a summary of a [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13jMRMsClaQvJ0C2YlxoU-yrhyezhZ0UPUhSAT3WN0cI/edit#slide=id.g55c21e2b16_2_1834) delivered by Larry Eichenbaum and James Nyika.

Agenda:
* What is Jupyter, Jupyter Lab and the use case
* When to Jupyter
* Existing Content Overview
* Demo
* How the Sausage is made - setting up Jupyter for yourself
* Questions

## What is Jupyter / Jupyter Lab ?

* **Jupyter Notebook** is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text
* **JupyterLab** is a web-based interactive development environment for Jupyter notebooks, code, and data. JupyterLab is the next-generation user interface for Jupyter notebooks that is more modular, allows you to open multiple notebooks at once and provides other useful features.
* Project Jupyter (https://jupyter.org/ ) is where it is hosted and maintained.

## The Use Case & Value

* Jupyter Lab can run different kernels. The most common is the python kernel.
* A lesser known kernel is the bash / shell kernel
* ðŸ’°: Allows notebooks to be used like a bash shell
* **Use Jupyter Lab to execute CLI commands to Vault, Nomad, Consul, or Terraform as part of a demo for a better experience**

## When to use Jupyter vs Instruqt

Jupyter excels when:

* You need to run a demo scenario with limited time
* You need to focus on telling a story and speaking
* You need to provide your audience with a history of the demo actions in a standard human readable format
* You need a non video recording of your demo
* You need to reuse your demo as a reference document
* You need to customize the experience for the customer

## Installation / Configuration of Jupyterlab

Official Docs: https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

### Mac / Homebrew

```shell
brew update && brew doctor
brew install python3
brew install jupyterlab
pip3 install --upgrade pip wheel setuptools
pip3 install ipykernel
pip3 install bash_kernel
python3 -m bash_kernel.install
```

For a more custom environment

```shell
brew upgrade
brew install pyenv
pyenv versions
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

### Windows

You need to do more - install Anaconda and configure: https://mycarta.wordpress.com/2019/07/09/from-zero-to-jupyterlab-pro-on-windows-10/

## Start Jupyter Lab - Mac and Windows

Go to a folder that holds or will hold your Jupyter Notebook.
Start up Jupyter Lab

Mac :

If installed from `brew`
```shell
jupyter lab
```

If installed from `pip`
```shell
jupyter-lab
```

or

Windows :

```
Jupyter lab
```

## Clear outputs

```shell
find terraform vault -name '*.ipynb' \
    | xargs -P 6 -n 1 jupyter nbconvert --clear-output --inplace
```

## Print to Notebook

### Extras

Install Latex
Mac - http://tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html



```
pip install -U notebook-as-pdf
# For chromium
pyppeteer-install
# For CLI
jupyter-nbconvert --to PDFviaHTML example.ipynb
```

Converting to PDF with Latex ala `mactex`
```
jupyter-nbconvert --to pdf example.ipynb
```
